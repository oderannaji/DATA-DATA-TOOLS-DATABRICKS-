Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s.

First, is a speculative\\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n\\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\\n\\nDISBURSEMENTS\\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n\\nREPORTING\\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\nWhat did you have in mind?

Crocker\"\" \\n<clclegal2@aol.com> \\nSubject: Investment Structure\\n\\n\\nSTRUCTURE:\\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\nliability of construction.\\n\\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\nis reduced.\\n\\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\nnon-recourse.\\n\\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n\\nEARLY LAND COSTS\\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n\\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\nthe \"\"fiscals\"\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n\\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n\\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\nstandpoint.\\n\\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\\nThere are three types of  construction loans.

I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \\nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \\nthis is out of his area but doesn\\'t  sound binding to him.? \\n?\\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen\\'s  transaction?and take a look at \\nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \\nneeded to complete this transaction.?

I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\"})]"
